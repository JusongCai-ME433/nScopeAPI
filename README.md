# nScopeAPI

nScopeAPI is used for communicating with nScope hardware.

This API and docs are in development at [github](http://github.com/nLabs-nScope/nScopeAPI/tree/develop).

Until v0.8 is released (projected October 18, 2016),
you must fork the develop branch of nScopeAPI to use this API as documented here.
